- I’m interested in coding (the other thing was uhhhhhh....)
- I’m currently learning how to make a Geometry Dash mod using Geode. (I gave up because of lack of helpful sources)
- You can reach me by messageing me @ brownieb934@gmail.com, or DevonMK/MalwareKat/MKsStudios on Geometry Dash
- Pronouns? Nah, I'm a boy.
- Fun fact, I remade Geometry Dash on Scratch! You can download it at [dvonmk](https://dvonmk.itch.io/funny-dash). All the artwork and code is mine.
- I'm remaking it AGAIN! [dvonmk](https://dvonmk.itch.io/siw)
